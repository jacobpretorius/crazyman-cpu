# Crazyman-PC

The idea here is to build a bitwise PC simulation essentially modelled on the fantastic breadboard pc video series by [Ben Eater on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). 

You can see it running here https://crazyman-pc.netlify.app/
