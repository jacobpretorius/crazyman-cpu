The idea here is to build a bitwise PC simulation essentially modelled on the fantastic breadboard pc video series by [Ben Eater on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). 

Long term we could take that PC simulation to the next level by adding in control logic/lookup logic from this 6502 NES simulation by [Onelonecoder on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XmxKPJDGU0). 

Basically all the difficult PC simulation problems has been done for us and we need to duplicate their efforts in JS/Vue/Vuex.
