# How to contribute

All contributions to be added and discussed via pull requests.

## Style

The idea here is not to build the most efficient or least memory/code/actual-cpu-cycle intensive simulation ever. It's a CPU running in your browser, that alone is silly enough. The idea is to have the code be easily understood and expanded on while really learning how CPU's and Vue/Vuex work.

Any other questions feel free to reach out to me via Github issues or on Twitter.
